To Do:
1. Now I need to check the difference 
between preprocessing and non processed dataset

    - talk about how each preprocessing step might affect the dataset
    - how balancing the data works.

2. deeper analysis on why the bert model works so well

3. try to reverse engineer it.

Findings:
Found that ChatGPT is very bad and producing good models
Testing out unsupersived and supervised models
Found a model that works very well
Attention mapping on the classifier does not tell us enough

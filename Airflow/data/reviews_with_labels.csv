18 Tsatskhvebi Street 4600 Kutaisi Georgia,2025-04-26,8.1,The Friends Hostel,United Kingdom,the family room was right next to reception which was a common area so sometimes people were chatting outside our room at night but they were quiet by 11pm they have a very cute puppy he is very nervous of people and you hear a lot of barking at night from the dogs in the neighborhood common in georgia there werent many people staying when we were there and the bathroom was always available but i wonder how it would be if it was busy,this seemed to be a very social hostel but not a party hostel we had the family room which was spacious and the beds were comfortable there were 2 shared bathrooms one opposite the room and the other one is downstairs these were always clean and stocked with toilet roll and hand wash there were hair dryers one night it was cold and the staff helped us to put the heating on in our room the dorms looked modern but i didnt see them very well there was a girls dorm and a mixed dorm and one other private room there was a fully stocked kitchen and a dining room breakfast was available for 10 gel each which we had one morning other meals were available upon request but we didnt partake it was approximately a 10 minute walk to the centre of kutaisi downhill we mainly got bolt taxis back because it was quite steep these were very cheap the hostel had film nights downstairs some evenings the hostel arranged us a tour to the prometheus cave and martvili canyon which we enjoyed and they gave us a lift to the meeting point there were washing machines available to use and the kitchen had a dishwasher many people staying there had been there longterm excellent value for money dog friendly,7,"['Leisure trip', 'Family with young children', 'Family Room with Garden View', 'Stayed 3 nights', 'Submitted from a mobile device']",0,0

18 Tsatskhvebi Street 4600 Kutaisi Georgia,2025-04-14,8.1,The Friends Hostel,Switzerland, hostel is very uphill it might look close to the center but you have to walk up quite a bit and after a full day of visiting it can be challenging we ended up going with taxi every time  this is a familyrun hostel this means there will be 2 kids going around and playing occasionally locking themselves in one of the only 2 toilets available just to play  maybe its just bad luck of having cold weather in april but hostel was freezing picture of the temperature inside bathroom is attached and everywhere else in the hostel the temperature was the same in the morning it was snowing and heating was off everywhere shower water was barely warm definitely not hot but in a 159c room with 82 humidity it was still steamy i hang my towel to dry after shower and next morning it was still wet like the day before we had to leave after the first night because of this i was given money back for the remaining days not for the night already spent but my friend didnt get any money back cause now we turned on heating in that room well the past night they didnt and in the rest of the hostel theres still no heating  volunteers that work there are either brain damaged or high as a kite i asked one of them about having money back he asked me to wait while he would ask the owner after 15 minutes of waiting i go look for him and find him ironing towels ah yes owner said that he would turn heating on well that was not my question and maybe next time come back to client to give the message instead of start doing other activities while having people waiting in a room pointlessly  except for wifi which is free everything else is to be paid even tea or coffee, beds are comfortable and equipped with electricity outlet  you are given a towel  price is cheap,2,"['Leisure trip', 'Group', 'Single Bed in Dormitory Room', 'Stayed 3 nights']",0,0

18 Tsatskhvebi Street 4600 Kutaisi Georgia,2024-11-13,8.1,The Friends Hostel,Philippines,i have nothing except because the floor is made of wood its squeaking a lot when someone walks during bedtime but for me its not that bad really i prefer the looks and feel of the wooden floors the place is really accessible you can walk about 15 minutes from the city centre the location is on the uphill part so you may struggle if you have luggage and decides to walk take a cab,very clean and the feeling of being at home the place is just really nice i think though i stayed in a room with multiple bunk beds theres ample space and theres still privacy being very spacious and bunk beds have curtains too it comes with breakfast which is really great for the price,10,"['Leisure trip', 'Solo traveler', 'Single Bed in Mixed Dormitory Room', 'Stayed 2 nights']",0,0

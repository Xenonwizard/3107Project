47 Hide Hill BerwickUponTweed TD15 1EQ United Kingdom,2024-12-16,9.6,The Balcony Luxury Apartment,United Kingdom,my only very very slight criticism would be that the apartments could do with having the names on the doors or some sort of identifying feature we werent initially sure which of the 3 was ours but thinking back it should have been obvious based on the order of the lockboxes but other than that our stay was perfect,our host was super helpful in sending us parking information well ahead of time and also sending the code for the lock box just prior to our arrival this was really smooth the apartment was decorated and furnished beautifully every detail has been carefully thought out and the decor really is 1010 the rooms are beautiful again with lots of lovely little touches that make it feel very luxurious but also homely and comfortable everything we needed was there the facilities were great and the location was perfect the apartment and communal entrance was absolutely spotless cannot recommend this place enough,10,"['Leisure trip', 'Family with young children', 'Three-Bedroom Premium Apartment with Balcony', 'Stayed 2 nights', 'Submitted from a mobile device']",0,0
